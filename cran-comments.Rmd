## Test environments
* local win install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:

* File 'MODA/libs/x64/MODA.dll':
  Found no calls to: 'R_registerRoutines', 'R_useDynamicSymbols'

 Users reported that this is a false positive when using devtools::check() in Rstudio.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of MODA.
No ERRORs or WARNINGs found.
