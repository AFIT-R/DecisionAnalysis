Description: Calculates the Single Attribute Value Function (SAVF) score for categorical
    distributions and increasing or decreasing linear or exponential functions.The SAVF 
    scores are used, along with a weights matrix, to calculate a Multi Attribute Value 
    Function (MAVF) score.Additional functions provide the ability to plot the value hierarchy tree, 
    plot the three types of SAVFs,plot a breakout of each alternatives' MAVF score, and plot a sensitivity
    analysis graph that illustrates how the MAVF scores change if the criteria weights change.
